# Installation

## Requirements

Random Teleport runs on the Java edition of Minecraft, either on your single player/local game or a dedicated server.

At now Random Teleport supports Forge and Fabric, so you can install only on Forge and Fabric.

### Basic requirements/recommendations for Forge version:
1. For Minecraft `1.14.4` is Forge `28.2.X`.
2. For Minecraft `1.15.2` is Forge `31.2.X`.

### Basic requirements/recommendations for Fabric version:
1. Just use a latest version :).

## Installing
1. In your game/server root folder, create a `mods` folder if one does not yet exist.
2. Download or copy `Random Teleport XXX-version.jar` into the `mods` folder.
3. Don't forget install dependencies (for Fabric is [Fabric Language Kotlin](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-language-kotlin/files) and [Fabric Api](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api/files)).
4. Start your server or client.
